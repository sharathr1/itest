My env: java version "1.8.0_144"

Eclipse: Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers. Version: Oxygen Release (4.7.0) Build id: 20170620-1800

Downloaded jar from https://projectlombok.org/download

execute command: java -jar lombok.jar

This command will open window as shown here https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse, install and quit the installer.

Add jar to build path/add it to pom.xml.

restart eclipse.

Go to Eclipse --> About Eclipse --> check 'Lombok v1.16.18 "Dancing Elephant" is installed. https://projectlombok.org/'
